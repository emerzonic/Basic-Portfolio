            Growing up in a not-tech-savvy environment, I used to love computers so much. 
            I can still recall my first encounter with the computer. My uncle took me to 
            his friend’s office for some business meeting. While they were busy with other things, the friend 
            asked me if I had the time, he would like for me to help type a quick document. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I did not hesitate to embrace the idea even though I knew that I will not complete the document 
            but that was an opportunity that I could not let pass by. After all, that was 
            going to be my first experience with the computer and I was going to have a 
            story for my buddies at school. With a mixture of joy and curiosity, I sat there poking around and pressing anything my fingers would
            reach. Like a cat checking to see if a mouse is dead or still alive. I touched every key on the keyboard 
            just to see what would have happen. After almost an hour, I had only managed to type few sentences but 
            yes that was an experience that lives on.

            My philosophy as an upcoming developer that is, “if I can dream it, I can build it.” 
            This philosophy has been carrying me through this newly found love and passion called “coding”. 
            Technology has always been my interest and I am glad that I can finally have the opportunity to do 
            what I like. Can you believe that most of my dreams these days are all about coding? No kidding, I am even 
            debugging in my dreams and applying the solutions when I wake up. Isn’t that amazing? My dream is to 
            build something that will change the world for the better.
